# Production-Readiness Assessment

## 1. Error Handling
The project includes validation error handling to ensure that invalid requests are handled gracefully. Custom exception handling provides user-friendly error messages and structured responses in the event of validation failures or other checked exceptions.

## 2. Security
Currently, no security measures are implemented. To make this project production-ready, the following security details should be added:

1. Ensure only authorized users can use this API by using JWT or OAuth
2. Use a CORS policy to allow only trusted origin

## 3. Communication with Proofreading API
1. Timeout Configuration:
Set connection and read timeouts for RestTemplate to prevent the application from being blocked by long delays from the external service.

2. Use a Retry Pattern:
When trying to communicate with the Proofreading Service, there is a chance that the service will not be available for communication,
so a retry pattern might be worth implementing...

3. Currently, the project uses RestTemplate for communication with the Proofreading Service, but no security mechanisms are in place for request authorization.
We could introduce an interceptor to attach authentication tokens to each request
